## 🚀 What is NextPropTrader?

NextPropTrader is a Dubai-based proprietary futures trading firm headquartered at The Meydan Hotel — one of the most recognisable addresses in the UAE's financial and trading community. Founded with a straightforward mission, NextPropTrader was built to be exactly what the prop trading industry has historically lacked: a firm with the fewest possible rules, no hidden fees, no payout complications, and a profit split that goes further than virtually any competitor. Rather than engineering complex, multi-layered evaluations designed to maximise failure rates, NextPropTrader stripped the model down to its essentials — a one-step challenge, a small set of clearly documented rules, and a 95% profit split waiting for every trader who passes.

What sets NextPropTrader apart immediately is that 95% figure. At a time when most futures prop firms offer 70% to 90% splits with multiple conditions attached, NextPropTrader puts ninety-five cents of every dollar of profit into the trader's pocket. Combined with weekly payouts via wire transfer, Bitcoin, and PayPal — processed multiple times per week, not once monthly — and a one-phase evaluation structure starting from just €38.15 per month for a $10,000 account after discounts, it is one of the most accessible and trader-generous futures prop firms available anywhere in 2026. Account sizes run from $10,000 all the way to $250,000, all trading live CME Group products including micro futures, on any Rithmic-compatible platform — including Quantower, Sierra Chart, ATAS, Jigsaw, VolFix, and Boomap.

## 💼 Why Choose NextPropTrader Over Other Prop Firms?

NextPropTrader has earned its reputation as one of the most rule-clean, high-payout futures prop firms operating in 2026. Here is what sets it apart:

- **95% profit split — the highest standard split in the futures prop industry** — while most competing firms offer 70%, 80%, or 90% splits with conditions and tiers attached, NextPropTrader pays out 95% from the very first payout with no progressive scaling, no minimum payout count requirement, and no percentage withheld pending performance review
- **One-phase evaluation — no multi-step hoops** — NextPropTrader runs a single evaluation phase; hit your profit target over a minimum of five trading days, stay within the max loss limit, and you are funded — there is no second verification phase, no consistency check, and no additional hurdle between evaluation and live capital
- **No daily loss limit** — unlike many prop firms that stop out traders mid-session because intraday equity briefly touched an arbitrary daily floor, NextPropTrader has no daily loss limit at all; the only protection rule is a trailing maximum loss limit, giving traders genuine freedom to manage positions across the full session
- **Trailing max loss limit — simple and transparent** — the maximum loss floor trails as account equity grows, locking in gains over time while protecting the firm from catastrophic drawdowns; the limit is clearly documented for each account size with no hidden calculation method or intraday equity snapshotting
- **No time limit on evaluations** — five trading days is the minimum required, but there is no maximum; traders can take as long as they need to reach their profit target without any evaluation expiry, monthly reset penalty, or pressure to rush a strategy that requires patience to execute correctly
- **Weekly payouts processed multiple times per week** — NextPropTrader processes payouts several times each week rather than once per month or bi-weekly, meaning traders do not wait long after hitting eligibility to receive their earnings
- **Three payout methods: wire, Bitcoin, and PayPal** — a broad range of withdrawal options covering both traditional bank transfers and crypto, making NextPropTrader one of the more flexible prop firms for international traders who need accessible withdrawal rails in different regions
- **Full CME Group product range including micro futures** — trade all current CME products across equity indices (ES, NQ, YM, RTY), currencies, metals, energies, and agricultural futures, with micro contract access available on every account tier — giving traders at the $10,000 level the same market access as those on the $250,000 account
- **Rithmic-compatible — works with virtually any professional platform** — because NextPropTrader is built on a Rithmic data feed, traders can use any platform capable of establishing a Rithmic connection, including Quantower, Sierra Chart, ATAS, Jigsaw, VolFix, Boomap, and many more — an unusually broad platform compatibility that most prop firms do not offer
- **Account reset and multi-account trading available** — if you breach the rules during evaluation, you can reset your account at any time rather than starting from scratch with a new purchase; traders can also run multiple evaluation accounts simultaneously, allowing parallel strategy testing across different instruments and account sizes
- **No liability for losses** — traders are never personally liable for losses on their funded accounts; if a funded account is lost, the evaluation fee is the total cost of the setback and the trader can restart the evaluation process at their discretion
- **Competitive monthly pricing with deep ongoing discounts** — list prices run from €109/month for the $10K account up to €499/month for the $250K account, but ongoing discounts already reduce these significantly before any promo code is applied, making NextPropTrader one of the most affordable futures prop firms per dollar of simulated capital at every account tier
- **Based in Dubai with a transparent company address** — NextPropTrader LLC is registered and headquartered at The Meydan Hotel, Dubai — a publicly disclosed address rather than the anonymised shell registrations used by some newer entrants to the futures prop space

## 🔓 Reduce Your Startup Cost with LM10

NextPropTrader evaluations already carry some of the most aggressively discounted pricing in the futures prop industry — as low as €38.15 per month for a $10,000 Beginner account with ongoing offers applied, rising to €174.65 per month for the $250,000 Extreme account. With the discount code **LM10**, you reduce that already competitive cost by a further 20%, making it the most affordable way to access a 95% profit split, a no-daily-loss-limit evaluation, weekly multi-payout processing, and full CME Group micro and standard futures access available anywhere in the prop trading market today.

Lower upfront cost means less financial pressure going into your evaluation, more freedom to let a disciplined strategy play out at its natural pace over the five-day minimum, and a cleaner mindset — without the anxiety of a daily loss limit lurking beneath every trade or a monthly rebilling cycle adding to the cost of a slow evaluation.

## 🙌 Who Should Use This Code?

- Futures traders who want the highest profit split available — 95% from the first payout, with no tier, no waiting period, and no percentage withheld for any reason
- Traders who have been stopped out mid-session by daily loss limits at other firms and want a one-phase evaluation where the only risk rule is a clearly defined trailing maximum loss limit
- Platform-specific traders who need Rithmic compatibility — NextPropTrader's open Rithmic connection works with Quantower, Sierra Chart, ATAS, Jigsaw, VolFix, Boomap, and virtually any other Rithmic-enabled platform without being locked into a single proprietary interface
- International traders who need flexible payout options — wire transfer, Bitcoin, and PayPal give traders across different regions multiple practical withdrawal routes without being forced into a single banking rail
- Budget-conscious traders who want the most affordable monthly entry to a 95% profit split and CME micro futures access, with no time limit on the evaluation and no extra fees after passing
- Traders who want multi-account flexibility — run multiple evaluation accounts simultaneously across different account sizes and instruments, with the ability to reset any account that breaches the rules rather than repurchasing from the start
